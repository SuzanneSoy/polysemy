;; Baz is a chimera created by mixing foo's identifier macro and bar's
;; match expander. Note that performing a plain rename-in on a polysemic
;; identifier would be a recipe for disaster (it would try to access meanings
;; based on its new name, instead of accessing meanings based on its former
;; name).
